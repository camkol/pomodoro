## My process

- This React application consists of a hierarchy of components starting with the App component as the root.
- The App component renders a card-like structure containing an Avatar component and a div for data display.
- The Avatar component displays an image. The Intro component provides introductory text about the developer.
- The SkillList component maps through an array of skills, rendering a Skill component for each skill item, passing in skill-related props like name, level, and color.
- Each Skill component displays a specific skill with its corresponding emoji based on the skill level.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a teston knowledge of components and props.

### Continued development

Maybe used for reference.
